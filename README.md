# entypo-rails

An asset pipeline plugin for Rails to easily add the [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/)
icon font faces and an initial set of icon classes.

## Entypo

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'entypo-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Either use the provided mappings, based on `icons-...` and the `:before`:

```scss
//= require "entypo"
```

```html
This is cool <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>.
```

or just include the entypo and entypo-social font faces and do the font face
mappings yourself, see http://www.entypo.com/characters/ for possible characters:

```scss
//= require "entypo-fonts"

i.cool:before { content: "üëç"; };
```

```html
This is cool <i class="cool"></i>.
```
